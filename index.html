        <p>🌧️ It was a stormy night. Rain lashed the windows. Somewhere in the city, a line of code was about to change everything…</p>

        <p>In a dimly lit room, <strong>Shrushty</strong> sat hunched over her terminal. Her hoodie cast a shadow across her determined eyes. The screen glowed as she whispered:</p>
        <em>"This isn't just code... it's a trigger."</em>

        <p>The script blinked:</p>
        <code>if clue == "decoded":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Proceed to Sector 7")</code>

        <p>Suddenly, a voice echoed from the speaker:</p>
        <em>“Condition met. Access granted.”</em>

        <p>A wall in front of her slid open, revealing a biometric scanner. She stepped forward, heart racing. Swiped her hand.</p>
        <strong>🟥 BEEP — ACCESS DENIED</strong>

        <p>“Why didn’t it work? The condition was true.”</p>

        <p>She pulled out her old black notebook: <em>“THE CONDITIONALS”</em>. Scribbled inside were messy words:</p>
        <blockquote>“Not all truths are the same in the world of logic.”</blockquote>

        <p>Her eyes widened. “Case-sensitive…” she muttered, smirking. She updated the code:</p>

        <code>if clue == "Decoded":</code>

        <p>Still, not good enough. She tried again — smarter this time:</p>

        <code>if clue.lower() == "decoded":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Proceed to Sector 7")</code>

        <p>🟩 <strong>BEEP — ACCESS GRANTED</strong></p>

        <p>Behind the wall: a secret vault. Massive screens flickered alive. Lines of code scrolled endlessly. The terminal lit up with one final message:</p>

        <code>WELCOME, SHRUSHTY.<br>NEXT CHALLENGE: "ELSE IF YOU DARE…"</code>

        <p>She smiled. Ready for whatever came next.</p>
